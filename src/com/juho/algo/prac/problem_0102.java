/**
 * Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
 * For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree 
 * along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7], Output: 42
 * 
 * 				-10
 * 				/ \
 * 			   9 [20]
 * 			     /  \
 *             [15] [7]
