 * We have a list of tasks to perform, with a cooldown period.
 * We can do multiple of these at the same time, but we cannot run the same task simultaneously.
 *
 * Given a list of tasks, find how long it will take to complete the tasks in the order they are input.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: tasks = [1, 1, 2, 1], cooldown = 2, Output: 7
 * Explanation: Order is 1 _ _ 1 2 _ 1
